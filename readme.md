# Status Posting System
This application allows the user to create a booking request
The form has a robust validation to ensure user input
Once the booking has been completed, its status is set to 'Unassigned.'

## Form Validation
Customer Name - Must not be empty
Phone Number - Must not be empty and length must be between 10-12
Street Number - Must not be empty
Street Name - Must not be empty
Date and Time - Displays the current system date and time and not allow bookings to be earlier than the current date and time

## Admin Search
Admin can search through the bookings generated labelled as 'Unassigned' by filling out the field
They can assign each booking and change its status to 'Assigned'
If the admin searches for a booking with an empty field, it will show bookings from within 2 hours
